# CL1-Codes
An attempt to simplify codes as much as possible.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
travellingSalesman.cpp ->

1).Please see the link mentioned in the code to understand what's going on.

2).To get the sequence in which cities were travelled, print out the contents of a when i==n

3). While constructing the graph, make sure that in the matrix you plot - if a path doesn't exist from say A to B,then assign a value like 999 to that place (a large value indicates that a path does not exist between those vertices).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
kMeans.cpp ->

1). Make sure the centroid you choose,belongs to one of the points.

2). The end result of the centroids will always be same (provided the points are same of course) as the code runs till hasAchievedPerfectCentroids = true.
